## How to run a demo

#### What you'll need

* node.js: you can pick it up over at https://github.com/joyent/node.git

* Google Chrome (or any browser with private mode): so you can run two sessions at once side-by-side

* A copy of this code, duh.

#### What to do

* Run `sudo node server/index.js`

* Open up `client/index.html` in Chrome

* Click on `Connect`

* Start a new private browsing window (ctrl+shift+n) and hit the same URL `client/index.html` and also click `Connect`

* You should have an active demo!
